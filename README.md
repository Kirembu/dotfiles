Vundle
======

VIM has several extension managers, but the one we strongly recommend is Vundle. Think of it as pip for VIM. It makes installing and updating packages trivial.

Letâ€™s get Vundle installed:

$ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
This command downloads the Vundle plugin manager and chucks it in your VIM bundles directory. Now you can manage all your extensions from the .vimrc configuration file.
